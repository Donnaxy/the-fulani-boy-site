    <h2>Excerpt from Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>The journey to Enugu was longer than I expected. The roads bent like questions, 
    carrying me farther from home with each rattling turn of the old bus. 
    I pressed my head against the window, watching fields of tall grass stretch into 
    the distance, feeling the hum of the engine in my chest. 
    Somewhere between the cattle paths and the city lights, I told myself: 
    this journey was not only to a new place — it was to a new life.</p>

    <p>Enugu was alive. The streets breathed with voices, colors, and scents I had never known. 
    Smoke curled from food stalls, laughter spilled into the evening air, and women in bright 
    wrappers called out prices over the rhythm of the marketplace. I clutched my small bag 
    tighter, reminded of how far I was from the familiar quiet of home.</p>

    <p>I stopped near a stall where roasted plantain was laid out in neat rows. 
    The seller’s hands moved quickly, her bangles catching the firelight. 
    As I reached into my pocket, I felt eyes on me. 
    Turning, I saw her.</p>

    <p>She stood at a window across the street, framed by the pale curtains of a modest house. 
    Her face caught the last light of day, soft and glowing, her chin resting in her hand. 
    Our eyes met — only for a moment — but it was enough. 
    The noise of the market fell away, and for the first time since leaving home, 
    I felt something other than uncertainty. I felt… possibility.</p>

    <p>She did not smile, not fully, but her gaze lingered. 
    A question passed between us, though neither of us spoke. 
    Who are you? Why now? Why here?  
    I lowered my head, heart racing, and pretended to study the roasted plantain, 
    yet every nerve in me remained fixed to that window. When I dared to glance back, 
    the curtains had closed.</p>

    <p>I carried the plantain in my hand, but it was not hunger that filled me. 
    It was her face, her presence, her silence. 
    Enugu was no longer just a city I had to survive. 
    It had become the place where fate — or something greater — had set a thread across my path.</p>

    <p>I did not yet know her name.  
    But in my heart, the story had already begun.</p>
